            <h1>About the Star</h1>
            <p>helyra is a red dwarf, a pre main sequence star of spectral type G-type main-sequence star (G dwarf). Helyra is orbited by six unique worlds. helyra's design is inspired by a cobination of yellow main sequence stars such as Earth's sun as well as NASA research on stars and their lifecycles.     </div>

                    Helyra is orbited by six diverse planets, each with its own unique characteristics and environments. These planets range from terrestrial worlds to gas giants and ice giants, showcasing a variety of planetary types within the same star system. The planets orbit Helyra at varying distances, resulting in different orbital periods and climatic conditions. Some of these world fall within Helyra's habitiable zone making them suitble for life. This diversity makes the Helyra star system a fascinating subject of study for astronomers and planetary scientists alike.

                <h2>Stellar Classification</h2>
                <p> Helyra is a T Tauri Star (early stage of a Sun-like stars): For stars like our sun, once the surrounding cloud of gas and dust has mostly dissipated, the star enters a T Tauri phase, also known as the pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase. This phase is characterized by strong stellar winds, variability in brightness, and the presence of a circumstellar disk from which planets may eventually form. Helyra is now entering it's main sequence phase, meaning Pyronis may be the last world that forms within Helyra's system. this also brightens the potential of life forming on on worlds such as Thalassa, Asteron and Gaia</p>

                <h2>age and lifespan</h2>
                <p>Rough astrophysical range: ~10^5 to 10^7 years, mostlikey around 50 million years old given that it is less massive that The Sun and that many of it's worlds are still forming. however the fact that distant gas giants exist in helyra's system suggests it has been around long enough for these massive planets to form and migrate outward.</p>

                <h2>chemical composition</h2>
                <p> Helyra is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of heavier elements. 
                    It's atoms consitatly go throigh nuclear fusion in its core, which produces the heat and light that define the star. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="container-info-short">
                <h2>fusion process</h2>
                <p>Helyra generates energy through the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium in its core, a process that releases a tremendous amount of energy and powers the star.</p>
                <p> the hazy envelope suggests strong stellar winds and ionized outflow; common in very young pre-main-sequence stars commonly have extended emission from heated gas and dust. </p>

                <h2>light spectrum</h2>
                <p>Light produced by Helyra spans a range of wavelengths, with a peak emission in the visible spectrum characteristic of G-type main-sequence stars. This emission includes a broad spectrum of colors, contributing to the star's overall brightness and color.</p>
