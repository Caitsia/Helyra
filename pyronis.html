            <h1>About Pyronis</h1>
            <p>Terrestrial magma planet with extreme volcanic activity and a molten surface. design and lore inspired by venus's surface and the volcanic activity observed there. in addition to magma exoplanets observed in other star systems, such as k2-141b. Pyronis contains massive oceans of lava and a perpetually changing landscape due to volcanic eruptions, shifting tectonic plates, and intense heat. The planet's atmosphere is thick with volcanic gases, creating a harsh environment that challenges any form of life as we know it.</p>

                <p>Pyronis Is the closest to it’s Star, being only 0.7 Astronomical Units (105 million Kilometers) away. magma planets often form in close proximity to their stars causing intense heat and volcanic activity. their orbits are often rapid, lasting roughly a few days compared to Earth.</p>
