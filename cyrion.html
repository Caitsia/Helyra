            <h1>About the Planet</h1>
            <p>Cyrion is a majestic ice giant, characterized by its swirling bands of colorful clouds and powerful storms. The planet's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane, ammonia, and water vapor that contribute to its vibrant appearance. Cyrion's design is inspired by the ice giants in our own solar system, such as Uranus and Neptune, but with unique features that set it apart. The planet boasts a series of prominent rings, similar to but distinct from those of Saturn, made up of ice particles and rocky debris, as well as a collection of moons that vary in size and composition.</p>

                <h2>Solar Orbit</h2>
                <p>Being the farthest planet in the system, Cyrion orbits its star at an average distance of approximately 19.2 astronomical units, taking about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit. Its orbit is slightly elliptical, contributing to variations in its distance from the star over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container-info-short">
                <h2>Rotation</h2>
                <p>Cyrion has a rapid rotation period of about 16 hours, resulting in a noticeable flattening at its poles and an equatorial bulge. This fast rotation also contributes to the dynamic weather patterns observed in its atmosphere. axial tilt is approximately 98 degrees, causing extreme seasonal variations.</p>

                <h2>Surface Features</h2>
                <p>
                    Cyrion's most striking surface features are its deep blue color and prominent cloud bands, which are created by strong winds and storms in the planet's atmosphere. 
                    methane in the upper atmosphere absorbs red light, giving Cyrion its characteristic blue hue.
                    Swirling storms, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, are also observed on Cyrion, adding to its dynamic and ever-changing appearance.

                <h2>Moons</h2>
                <p>Cyrion has a diverse collection of moons that vary in size and composition. Some of its notable moons include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Frostia:</b> The largest moon of Cyrion, Frostia is an icy world with a thin atmosphere and surface features such as ice volcanoes and vast plains of frozen methane.</li>
                    <li><b>Glacius:</b> A medium-sized moon characterized by its heavily cratered surface and subsurface ocean, which may harbor the potential for microbial life.</li>
                    <li><b>Zephira:</b> A small, irregularly shaped moon with a rocky surface and a tenuous atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen and methane.</li>

                <h2>Ring System</h2>
                <p>Cyrion is encircled by a prominent ring system composed of ice particles and rocky debris. The rings are relatively thin but wide, extending several thousand kilometers from the planet's equator. They are believed to have formed from the remnants of a shattered moon or captured material from the surrounding space.</p>
