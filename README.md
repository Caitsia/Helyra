Helyra is A fantastical alternate reality solar system based on scientific research. The project deverables include a digital, scroll-based website combining educational content with an interactive solar system simulation.
The orbit simulation is the centerpiece of Helyra’s interactivity.  Inspired by NASA interfaces but scaled to 2D, it allows users to pan and zoom, click planets, and view name tags directly within the simulation. This design helps new users quickly learn planetary names and categories. Project Development Progress
This project aims to better understand how scientific research can be integrated into imaginative fictional settings. Additionally, it tests whether interactive visuals improve comprehension and enhance user engagement. The broader objective is to explore ways artists and designers can use natural phenomena to influence art and media. Hypothesis: Effective  interactive visuals and intuitive UX structure meaningfully enhance users’ engagement, comprehension, and exploration within an educational narrative website.

Results of development:
Working prototype
Refined site map and UX flow
Improved technical proficiency in JavaScript and Figma
Developed a unique visual language
Integrated scientific and artistic research into cohesive planetary designs
