            <h1>About Aurora</h1>
            <p>Aurora is a majestic gas giant, characterized by its swirling bands of colorful clouds and powerful storms. The planet's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane, ammonia, and water vapor that contribute to its vibrant appearance. 
                Aurora's design is inspired by the gas giants in our own solar system, such as Jupiter and Saturn, but with unique features that set it apart. 
                The planet boasts a series of prominent rings composed of dust and ice particles, as well as a collection of moons that vary in size and composition.</p>

                <h2>Solar Orbit</h2>
                <p>Aurora's orbit around its star takes approximately 12 Earth years to complete. It's distance from the star varies due to its elliptical orbit, but on average, Aurora's distance is about 7.2 astronomical units.</p>

                <h2>Rotation</h2>
                <p>Aurora completes one rotation on its axis in about 10 hours, making it one of the fastest rotating planets in its solar system.</p>

                <h2>Surface Features</h2>
                <p>
                    Aurora's most striking surface features are its vibrant cloud bands, which are created by strong winds and storms in the planet's atmosphere. 
                    The planet is also known for its spectacular auroras, which light up the polar regions with dazzling displays of color.
                    Aurora's occur when charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines, hence the planet's name.

                <h2>Atmospheric Composition</h2>
                <p>Aurora's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane, ammonia, and water vapor. These components give the planet its characteristic colors and contribute to the formation of clouds and storms.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container-info-short">
                <h2>Climate and Weather</h2>
                <p>The climate of Aurora is dynamic and ever-changing, with powerful storms and high-speed winds that can reach up to 600 kilometers per hour. The planet's weather patterns are influenced by its rapid rotation and the heat generated from its interior.</p>

                <h2>Moons</h2>
                <p>Aurora has a diverse system of moons, ranging from small rocky bodies to larger icy satellites. Some of the most notable moons include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Lumina:</b> A bright, icy moon known for its reflective surface.</li>
                    <li><b>Zephyrus:</b> A rocky moon with a thin atmosphere and evidence of past volcanic activity.</li>
                    <li><b>Nebula:</b> A small moon with a heavily cratered surface, indicating heavy pelting from meteoroids.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="container-info-short">
                <h2>Rings</h2>
                <p>Aurora is surrounded by a series of rings composed of ice and rock particles. These rings are relatively thin but extend far from the planet, creating a stunning visual effect when viewed from space. The rings are believed to have formed from the debris of shattered moons or comets that ventured too close to the planet.</p>
